### Words can cross dimensions
This project is under very active development. We are doing everything we can, as fast we can & as best as possible, to deliver a powerful software. We've released a very early alpha (I know you won't call it that) as a public open source project. This is about books, folks. It can't be close.

# Wanna contribute?
We are doing this for free, just for the sake of making something different about books.
We don't want to spoil anything, don't we? 
Pay attention.

#### You can help in our cause. «¿Do you need a hand? I have two»
```
$ git clone https://github.com/matikbird/textile-mobile-app
$ cd textile-mobile-app
```

Introduce those commands in your CLI and you will have access to the files (or download it here as a ZIP).
Copy those files and place them in the root folder of the project (*Textile*)

Plugins: Statusbar, SplashScreen, Crosswalk (XWalk)

#### Starting
Building the app from scratch (asuming you have Node.js/NPM and Android SDK installed)

```
$ cordova create Textile com.Textile Textile
$ cd Textile
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
$ cordova platform add android
```

There you have it. Now, paste the zipped files in *Textile* folder.
When the files are copied, now we can proceed to build the binaries.

$ cordova build android
```
#### Run app
```
$ cordova run android
